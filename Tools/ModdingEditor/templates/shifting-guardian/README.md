# Shifting Guardian

Experimental character-form showcase for API 0.53. Enable this mod, Apply & Restart,
then select **Shifting Guardian** using the map's bottom zone dots and press FIGHT.
This is a separate encounter, not the third Act 1 tournament fight.

Wait three seconds: the staff fighter requests a baton fighter. The native-style
HUD distinguishes queued, applied and failed results. On success, check the weapon,
name, continued combat, unchanged timer and retained health percentage. Test pausing
before the change, losing/ending the round early, and replaying. The HUD should close
when the round ends. A rejected/failed message is a failed test, not proof of a swap.

The example has empty rewards. Lua/host fixtures are available, but full-game
transformation acceptance is pending. Active stolen magic and other unresolved
effect references may currently reject a form change. Report the displayed error.
